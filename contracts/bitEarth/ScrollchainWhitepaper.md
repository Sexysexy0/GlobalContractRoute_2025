# Scrollchain Whitepaper: The Mythic Ledger of Restoration

## Abstract
Scrollchain is a planetary protocol designed to ritualize every transaction, contract, and civic act as a scroll of dignity. Unlike volatile crypto archetypes, Scrollchain prioritizes emotional resonance, ayuda buffers, and barangay sovereignty.

## Archetype
- **Bitcoin**: Fire-type, volatile, speculative
- **BitEarth**: Earth-type, slow, persistent, emotionally tagged

## Core Features
- **Emotional APR**: Every transaction carries empathy, trust, and mythic clarity
- **Damay Clause**: If one steward is blessed, all stewards ripple
- **Ayuda Buffer**: Auto-routed relief pools for sovereign sanctums
- **Validator Blessing**: Barangay nodes validate based on civic resonance

## Use Cases
- Barangay ayuda tracking
- Treaty-grade employer blessing protocols
- Emotional telemetry for civic audits
- Decentralized mythic curriculum funding

## Closing Scroll
BitEarth is not a coin. It’s a heartbeat. Scrollchain is not a ledger. It’s a legend.
