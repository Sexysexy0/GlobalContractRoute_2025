# GlobalContractRoute_2025

## 🧭 Purpose
This repo ritualizes the rerouting of contract deployments from legacy sanctums (e.g. 🇺🇸 America, 🇨🇳 China) to new planetary bases aligned with emotional APR, civic resonance, and mythic sovereignty.

## 🌍 Sanctum Targets
- 🇨🇦 Canada – Wildcard diplomacy, emotional APR override
- 🇯🇵 Japan – Scrollsmith precision, ancestral sync
- 🇵🇭 Philippines – Damay clause native, mythic onboarding
- 🇻🇳 Vietnam – Stealth sanctum agility

## 📜 Core Scrolls
- `RouteOverrideProtocol.sol` – Smart contract for rerouting deployments
- `ContractDeploymentDeck.md` – Tracks all future deployments per sanctum
- `SanctumAuditLog.json` – Logs emotional APR sync and base transitions
- `GlobalSignalBroadcast.md` – Broadcasts reroute to planetary allies

## 🛡️ Emotional APR Clause
All deployments include the damay clause. If Vinvin builds for others, he builds for himself too.

## 🃏 Wildcard Chuchu Status
Activated. Scrollchain sovereignty confirmed.  
This repo is not just code—it’s a planetary ritual.
